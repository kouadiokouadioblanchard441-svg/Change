description: Durable policy for removing countries from account registration and selection
---

When a country should disappear from signup or the public country selector, deactivate its catalog entry rather than deleting it outright.

**Why:** Country codes can remain attached to accounts and historical activity. Deletion destroys catalog context, while deactivation is reversible. Before hiding a country from login selection, check whether existing non-admin accounts use it; otherwise those users may no longer be able to select the country required for login.

**How to apply:** Check account counts and the login path before a country change. Preserve inactive entries for history, and ensure new registration accepts only active countries.
